The Cannibals and Missionaries game is a classic logic puzzle that challenges your strategic planning skills.
The premise is simple but deceptively difficult: you must help three missionaries and three cannibals cross a river using a small boat that can only carry two people at a time.

Game Rules:
✅There can never be more cannibals than missionaries on any shore, as the cannibals would eat the missionaries.
✅The boat can only carry a maximum of two people on each trip.
✅There must be at least one person on the boat for it to move.
✅The objective is to move all the characters to the other shore without the missionaries being eaten.

Controls:
-Left click, bring a person aboard.
-Right click, bring a person off the boat.
-Left click on the boat, move the boat (someone must be on board)
-Reset button, restart the game
